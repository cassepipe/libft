	 * The fact that many implementations print a string such as (null) when passed a null pointer is a kindness that is dangerous to rely upon. The beauty of undefined behaviour is that such a response is permitted, but it is not required. Similarly, a crash is permitted, but not required (more's the pity â€“ people get bitten if they work on a forgiving system and then port to other less forgiving systems)
